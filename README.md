# Contructor Word Guess
Contructor Word Guess is a CLI app that allows you play hangman using words in a words.txt document.

## Getting Started
The code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/ST3AMMACH1N3/constructorWordGuess).
 - Once you have all of the files downloaded use npm to install dependecies.
    ```
    npm i
    ```

 - Make sure you have a word.txt file in the same directory with words each on their own line. e.g.
    ```
    javascript
    jquery
    html
    css
    node
    inquirer
    ```

 - After your word bank is in place, and all of the dependencies are installed simply start the game with node.
    ```
    node index.js
    ```

- Once the game has begun guess one letter at a time by typing the letter and pressing enter.

- Once you have correctly guessed all of the letters in the word, or run out of guesses, you will be greeted with the option to play again.

## Built With

 - [Inquirer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer) - A collection of common interactive command line interfaces.
